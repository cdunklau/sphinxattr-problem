Using SomeClass objects
#######################

SomeClass Attributes
====================

Full documentation of the attributes is in the API documentation for
:class:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass` objects.

.. note::

    The links for the below attributes don't get created

The attributes that are likely the most useful are:

-   :attr:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.id`: ID
-   :attr:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.workflow_state`: Check the workflow state
-   :attr:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.age`: How long ago
    (in milliseconds) the thing was last seen online.
-   :attr:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.name`: The name of the thing
-   :attr:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.host`: The IP address or hostname


.. note::

    But class and method refs do work properly...

:class:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass` instances also have a
:meth:`~mypkg.models.SomeClass.some_method` method.


.. todo::

    Make these links work. Probably need to write an SSCCE to figure out why it
    isn't working.
